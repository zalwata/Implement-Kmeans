"""
File: kNN.py

This file contains a single class definition from which
k-nearest neighbor models can be instantiated.

This class implements two methods: train and predict.

While the k-nearest neighbor algorithm does not require training,
the api has been defined like this to remain consistent with other
open-source machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
